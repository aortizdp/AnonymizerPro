🔒 AI Anonymizer Pro: The Complete ManualWelcome to the official documentation for AI Anonymizer Pro. This guide covers everything from the initial concept to the final deployment on a production server.1. The Core IdeaThe project was born from a specific need: How can we remove sensitive data from documents without sending that data to a third-party cloud?The Problem: Using Generative AI (like ChatGPT) for anonymization often involves sending raw, sensitive data to external servers, which violates many privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA).The Solution: A local, private tool that uses Non-Generative NLP to detect and mask Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entirely on the host machine.2. Project Planning & ArchitectureTo make the app professional and maintainable, we chose a Modular Architecture:Frontend (Streamlit): Handles the user interface, file uploads, and language switching.Backend (FastAPI): A high-performance API that processes the files using the NLP engine.Decoupled Configuration:config.py: Stores all external links (GitHub, BMC, Personal Web) to avoid "hardcoding" URLs.translations.py: A centralized dictionary for multi-language support (EN, CA, ES, FR, DE).3. Tech Stack: Selected LibrariesWe selected specific libraries based on a balance of performance, privacy, and ease of use:LibraryRoleWhy?Alternatives ConsideredStreamlitUI FrameworkFastest way to build data-centric web apps in Python.Flask or React (Too complex for this scope).FastAPIAPI EngineAsynchronous and extremely fast for file handling.Django (Too heavy/slow for simple APIs).Spacy/PresidioNLP CoreIndustry-standard for PII detection without internet access.NLTK (Less accurate for modern entities).PandasData ProcessingNecessary for handling .xlsx and .csv structures.Openpyxl (More limited for data analysis).python-docxWord SupportAllows the tool to parse and rebuild .docx files.PDFMiner (Only for PDFs).4. How the Tool Works (The User Guide)This tool follows a simple Two-Step Security Workflow:Step A: AnonymizationUpload a document (.xlsx, .csv, or .docx).The NLP engine identifies entities (Names, IDs, IBANs, etc.).The system replaces them with placeholders (e.g., USER_1, IBAN_A).Output: You receive a .zip containing the Anonymized File and a decryption_keys.xlsx file.Step B: Deanonymization (Restoration)Upload the Anonymized File.Upload the decryption_keys.xlsx file.The tool "translates" the placeholders back to their original values.Output: You get the original document restored.5. Development Journey: Trial & ErrorBuilding this in January 2026 brought unique challenges:The 2026 Syntax Update: Streamlit deprecated use_container_width. We had to manually update all instances to width="stretch" to keep the app functional.Git Secret Scanning: During a push, GitHub blocked the operation because it detected a Personal Access Token in the code. We resolved this by sanitizing the code and switching to SSH-based commits.Privacy First: We conducted a "Cookie Study" and decided on a Zero-Cookie policy to avoid the need for annoying pop-up banners.6. GitHub & DeploymentThe code is managed and deployed through professional DevOps practices:Repository: Hosted at GitHub.License: MIT License (Open Source), allowing anyone to audit or improve the code while protecting the author from liability.Startup Script: We created run_all.sh to launch both the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend in one command.7. Branding & MonetizationVisuals: The header banner was generated using Gemini AI, focusing on a "Privacy Shield" aesthetic.Sustainability: A Buy Me a Coffee (BMC) integration was added to the sidebar to help cover server maintenance costs.8. Infrastructure: Nginx & SSLTo reach the public domain anonymizerpro.thedepablos.com, we configured:Nginx Reverse Proxy: Acts as the traffic controller, forwarding requests to the internal Streamlit port (8501).SSL Certificate: Secured via Let's Encrypt (Certbot). We resolved a port 80 conflict (Address already in use) by properly stopping competing services before the SSL handshake.WebSocket Headers: Crucial Nginx settings (Upgrade and Connection) were added to ensure Streamlit remains interactive behind the proxy.9. Future RoadmapSupport for PDF files.Custom PII entity definitions (Regex support).Docker containerization for even easier local deployment.© 2026 Project created by Albert Ortiz.
